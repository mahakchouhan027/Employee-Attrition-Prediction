Employee attrition means employees leaving a company, and it can quietly cause big problems and extra costs. Hiring new people isn’t just about paying their salary — it also takes time and effort to recruit, train, and help them settle in.

Hiring and training a new employee can be expensive, often more than their salary.

Small companies can spend over $1,500 per employee on training.

It can take several months for a new employee to become fully productive.

In this project, I created a Machine Learning model to predict which employees might leave. I looked at the data using charts and graphs to understand patterns, and tried different ML algorithms to get the best results.

I trained the model on the IBM HR Analytics Employee Attrition & Performance dataset from Kaggle, and Logistic Regression worked well.
